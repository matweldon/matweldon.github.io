<p>I&rsquo;m a Senior Data Scientist, working on Privacy Enhancing Technologies at the
<a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk">Data Science Campus</a> 
(<a href="https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/author/mat-weldon">profile</a>) 
of the UK <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/">Office for National Statistics</a>.
Prior to joining the ONS, I worked at the Department for Education as an Economic Adviser.</p>
<p>Before joining the civil service, 
I completed a PhD in statistics and conducted research in the economics of education at the University of Lancaster.
Before that, I worked for several years in administrative jobs in the private and public sectors.</p>
<p>I live in Morecambe with my family.</p>

<h3 id="civil-service-code">Civil service code</h3>
<p>As a civil servant, I take my responsibilities to comply with the
<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/civil-service-code/the-civil-service-code">Civil Service Code</a> 
seriously.
I endeavour not to express any opinions that would bring my integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality into doubt.
Please get in touch if you see anything here that you think isn&rsquo;t compatible with my public service role.</p>
