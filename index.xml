      <description>&amp;lsquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t just do something &amp;ndash; stand there!&amp;rsquo; Occasionally, as a practicing Buddhist, I visit a Zen Buddhist temple in Northumbria for a few days. And when I visit I, like all visitors and monks, do my part of the daily work in the monastery: cleaning; helping in the kitchen; outdoor work; sewing. The most busy time is after meals, when volunteers are asked for to do kitchen clean-up. As you can imagine, people are keen to muck in, so quite often more people turn up than there are jobs to be done.</description>

      <description>This post is just an experiment to see if I can make a workflow from handwritten notes on my iPad to publication quickly. It&amp;rsquo;s not a full post but a fragment of ideas I wrote freehand and then converted using iPad&amp;rsquo;s built-in text conversion tools.
Regional automatic stabilisers Tom Forth writes that it is unfair that the South East contributes more than its fair share to public services. It&amp;rsquo;s an important point.</description>

      <description>My local corner shop now has three whole shelves dedicated to american confectionary: varieties of peanut-butter filled Reeses pieces; chews unaccountably claiming to be &amp;lsquo;grape&amp;rsquo; flavoured; vomit-tainted Hershey chocolate; and so on. I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed the same pattern in other shops too. This is not a complaint: the sweets are clearly fashionable, and in general (apart from Hershey bars) don&amp;rsquo;t taste any worse than the sickly-sweet, artificial treats I&amp;rsquo;m used to from my childhood.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>
